# AO Bake Component

The AO bake is a component created for [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). It will automatically bake the ambient occlusion to the vertex colors to geometry of meshes. 

## Gotchas

* Because the AO is baked to the vertex colors the more geometry the better the effect.
* Can be quite slow, so once backed, it is advised to export the colors to a gltf model using aframes export feature.
* If polygons overlap without verts along the intersection then the results will be off.
         
## Properties
| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| sample-rate | 3 | The number of samples to take in each direction, higher values give better results but take more time |
| gamma | 3 | The gamma to apply to the resulting AO, higher values give higher contrast |
| exposure | 1 | Adjusts the amount of exposure the AO produced |
| distance | 5 | The maximum distance to consider as occulded |
| auto-apply | true | Will automatically generate the AO on load |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| applyAO | Manually apply AO when auto-apply is false |


## Events

| Name | Event Type | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| children-ready | N/A |  Dispatched when all models in child elements have finshed loading |
| ao-baked | N/A |  Dispatched when the AO has been baked |

## How to Use

To use the component you just add the component to the A-Frame entity containing the html.  For example:
```html
<a-scene>
    <a-entity aobake>
      <a-torus-knot material="color: #fff" position="0 1 -4" arc="180" p="2" q="3" radius="1" radius-tubular="0.2"></a-torus-knot>
	  </a-entity>
</a-scene>
```
